    <h1>When You Are Old</h1>
    <h2>by William Butler Yeats</h2>
    <h3>From "A Poem for Every Autumn Day"</h3>
    <div class="odd"><span class="old">When you are old</span> and grey and full of sleep,</div>
    <div class="even">And nodding by the fire, take down this book,</div>
    <div class="odd">And slowly read, and dream of the soft look</div>
    <div class="even space">Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;</div>
    <div class="odd">How many loved your moments of glad grace,</div>
    <div class="even">And loved your beauty with love false or true,</div>
    <div class="odd">But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,</div>
    <div class="even space">And loved the sorrows of your changing face;</div>
    <div class="odd">And bending down beside the glowing bars,</div>
    <div class="even">Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled</div>
    <div class="odd">And paced upon the mountains overhead</div>
    <div class="even space">And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.</div>
